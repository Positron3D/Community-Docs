# Tools you will need

While for the most part the Positron only needs tools you probably
already have, there are some that you might find you need to acquire:

- M3 tap
- M6 tap
- Undersized 10mm reamer
- 4mm reamer
- 6mm drill bit
- 8mm drill bit
- 1/4" NPT pipe tap
- JST PH-series crimp tool

There are some that are strictly optional, but come in handy:

- Brass insert attachment for soldering iron
- 6.1mm reamer
